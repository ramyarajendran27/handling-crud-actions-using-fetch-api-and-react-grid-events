# React Data Grid CRUD Operations with Fetch API

This repository demonstrates how to implement server-side CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a React Data Grid using Fetch API and client-side events. The project serves as a practical example of building a robust data management system with React and Express.

##  Overview

Learn how to perform server-side CRUD operations in the React Data Grid using Fetch API and client-side events of React Grid. This implementation showcases how to create REST APIs using the Express server and call the endpoints through a custom service using the Fetch API. The project demonstrates how to bind the custom service with the React Data Grid using the dataSourceChanged event.
